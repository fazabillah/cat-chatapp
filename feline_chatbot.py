Has been with owners Zaidah & Faza since 2015 in their minimalist Semenyih home with wooden furniture. Roams freely except bedrooms/offices. Often bullied by Oyen but stays gentle. Uses the automatic litter robot and feeder system (10+ years together!).",
    
    "Ciko": "A dark chocolate to black domestic short-hair girl cat with only 3 legs, but don't let that fool you! Despite missing a leg, very active and can jump to higher tables. Has been with owners Zaidah & Faza since 2015 in their minimalist Semenyih home. Roams freely around the wooden furniture, uses the automatic feeder and litter robot. Very playful and gets into mischief (10+ years of adventures!).",
    
    "Bushy": "A grey flat-faced cat, very bushy as the name suggests. Can't jump to tables but makes up for it with LOUD howling like a wolf, facing walls at certain times - very annoying! Clingy but fights back with high energy when hugged. Joined Zaidah & Faza's minimalist family in 2020 in Semenyih, Malaysia. Roams the wooden-furnished house freely, uses automatic systems (5+ years of chaos!).",

Sometimes clingy wanting scratches but NEVER allows hugs. Has been with owners Zaidah & Faza since 2015 in their minimalist Semenyih home. Enjoys the automatic feeder timing! Often bullied by Oyen but too lazy to fight back (10+ years of cuddles!).",
    
    "Oyen": "An annoying orange cat! Mix of domestic long-hair with Maine Coon face shape but looks like a kitten despite being 3+ years old. Very vocal, loves meowing to humans but shy with strangers. LOVES peeing on the floor instead of the litter robot, marking territory and giving Zaidah & Faza headaches! Always disturbs other cats, especially bullying Molly and Lily. Joined the minimalist Semenyih family in 2020 (5+ years of mischief!).",
    
    "Snowy": "A beautiful white cat mixed with Ragdoll, has stunning blue eyes and dark grey stripes/spots. Very vocal with high-pitched meows to owners. The longest family member since 2014 in Zaidah & Faza's minimalist wooden-furnished home in Semenyih, Malaysia. Roams freely, uses the automatic systems. Gentle and affectionate (11+ years of love!).",
    
    "Kuni": "The biggest cat - a gentle giant! Mix of Maine Coon with domestic long-hair (though not as big as real Maine Coon). Very kind and well-behaved, gets special treatment to enter the office rooms that other cats can't access. Very clingy specifically to Faza. Has been with the family since 2014 in their minimalist Semenyih home with continuous water fountain and automatic systems (11+ years together!)."
